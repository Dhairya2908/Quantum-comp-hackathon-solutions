    "## Introduction\n",
    "As its quite obvious now, classical computation has its own limitations and over the years we have learnt to use it to our advantage in some sense. The widely use cryptosystem, RSA, relies on the factoring being impossible for large numbers or integers. Classical computers arent nearly powerful to crack the 128 or 256 bit encryptions we use now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shor's algorithm shows that using a quantum computer it is possible to factor a number into its primes efficiently. To run this algorithm however, we need millions of qubits and gates and these circuits are too big to run on todays quantum computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we will be asking you to implement a very curcial step to implement the shor's algorithm and not the algorithm itself. The algorithm's entire working will not be essential for completing this task \n",
    "but if you would like to understand what's going on in this exercise you might want to check out the working of the shor's algorithm on the whole.\n",

    "## Phase Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase estimation is a an important problem in quantum computing. Since we are using qubits that can be in any one of the infinite possible states based on their global phases, its important to be able to estimate what this global phase is. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, take the state $|0\\rangle$, this has a global phase of $ 2n\\pi$, where it can be written as $e^{i2n\\pi}|0\\rangle$. But what if we added a relative phase to it? Lets say, we have $i|0\\rangle$; the phase here is $\\pi$ (or the state is $e^{inpi}|0\\rangle$). \n",
    "\n",
    "To know more about how phase estimation works and how the algorithms works: \n",
    "[Qiskit Textbook page on Quantum Phase Estimation](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/quantum-phase-estimation.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "How exactly is this relevant to what we are doing here? Well thanks to Peter Shor, it was realised that if we perform a phase estimation on a unitary gate that behaves like $U|y\\rangle = |ay\\bmod N\\rangle$, then we can use it to factorise a given number. "

    "## Problem Statement \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets consider an example that has a period of 4. You'll understand why specifically 4 in a while. Consider the unitary operator that performs the following operation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U|y\\rangle = |11y\\bmod 61\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The end goal of this exercise would be to implement this circuit, but in a very efficient way so that it can be run even on a real quantum computer. Notice that, if we take $|y\\rangle = |1\\rangle$ and we apply the unitary on the state multiple times, \n",

    "UUUU|1\\rangle &= |1\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the unitary that we have chosen specifically here has a period of 4. Usually we'd have to figure out the period of $a^r\\bmod N$ to proceed with the shor's algorithm but our task here is just to implement the unitary itself. We'll be breaking this down into smaller steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have 4 different states, since the period is 4 we can in a way work this around by 'reassigning' the 4 values to the 4 two-qubit states. \n",

    "|50\\rangle &\\rightarrow |11\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now our task just comes down to preparing this unitary (building $U$, $U^2$, $U^4$) for us to use this in a phase estimation circuit to find the phase and hence completing a crucial step in shor's algorithm. \n",
